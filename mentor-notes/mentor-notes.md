# Notes For Mentors

Total Time: 1 hour

## Suggestions For Delivering the Workshop

#### Introducing the topic | Mentor presents to group & take questions | 5 mins
- Present pages 3-6 of Carnegie Mellon presentation on "The Importance of Software Architecture"
- Read through "What Is Software Architecture?" section of README


#### Exercise 1 | Mentor chooses two volunteers: one reads the bullet points one by one in Exercise 1, the other tries to represent each bullet point by drawing on the whiteboard | 10 mins
- Encourage others to call out ideas. Emphasise that there is no one right way to draw it.

#### Why whiteboard architecture? & Why Is Architecture Important? | Present to group & take questions | 5 mins
You can show page 7 of Carnegie Mellon presentation as well.

#### Research types of software architecture | Independent research, followed by discussion | 10 mins
Ask them to focus on Client/Server architecture, its pros and cons, how it compares / can be used alongside other approaches.

Then you can ask for different people to name one advantage of using the client/server approach. E.g. higher security, easier to maintain, centralised data access...

#### Go through the Key Principles | Present to group & take questions | 5 mins
Some of the principles might need further explanation. So you can ask different people what they think each one means.

#### Exercise 2 | Working in pairs | 20 mins
Allow them at least 15 minutes to do this, but be flexible with timings.
Ask at least two teams to present their different approaches afterwards.

(If it seems like they could do with some help, you can show the file structure of one of your past projects. This brings up interesting questions.
E.g. "What is 'src'?", "What are 'public' and 'assets' folders?", "Why are those files at the root?")

#### Exercise 3 | Working individually | 5 mins
It is better to ask them to look at the file structure of their *solo* projects, rather than their group projects. Because they can make changes easily.

*Wrap up!*
